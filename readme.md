Todo-List Manager is a program that allows
users to create, delete, and manage multiple
todo lists. Within this guide you will find
the functions the program and how to use them.

On the main application window, there are
various buttons, along with a table. The buttons
serve as ways to add, remove, edit, save, and
load lists, while the table serves to display
the todo lists created and their respective
data's.

To create a todo-list, click on the "Add List"
button. A GUI will then pop up asking the user
for the data to be inserted for a new todo list.
The newly created todo list will then be displayed
in the table below.

To remove a todo-list, click on the remove list
button and type the name of the todo-list which
you wish to delete. It will then remove it from
the table.

To edit a todo-list, click the edit list button,
and type in the name of the todo list. Then, type
in any values you wish to change. The modifications
will be displayed in the table.

You can filter the todo lists with the dropdown
menu on the top right of the screen. Choose between
the options listed, and view the modified display
in the table.

To save a list, use the save list button on the
bottom left. Type in the full name of the todo list,
and it will be saved to a JSON file.

To save all lists, use the save all lists button. This
will then save every list in the table, each to their
respective JSON file.

To load a list, use the button on the bottom right. Type
in the name of the list and its respective JSON file
will be loaded. The loaded todo-list will be displayed
in the table.
